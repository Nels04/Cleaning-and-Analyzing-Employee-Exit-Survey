# Cleaning-and-Analyzing-Employee-Exit-Survey
In this project we'll work with the exit survey from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_(Queensland)) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland(https://www.tafensw.edu.au/), Australia. For documentation you can find the DETE survey here(https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).

We'll analyze the datasets and answer the questions below:

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
